                        <h3>Law 1: Never Outshine the Master</h3>
                        <p>Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please or impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity.</p>

                        <p>Friends will more quickly betray you because they are easily aroused to envy. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove.</p>

                        <h3>Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions</h3>
                        <p>Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense.</p>

                        <h3>Law 4: Always Say Less Than Necessary</h3>
                        <p>When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.</p>
